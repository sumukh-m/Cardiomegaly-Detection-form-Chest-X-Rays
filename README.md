# Cardiomegaly Detection using Chest X-Rays using CNN and Transfer Learning

The "Cardiomegaly Detection using Chest X-Rays using CNN and Transfer Learning" project aims to develop a robust and accurate automated system for detecting cardiomegaly, a condition characterized by an enlarged heart, by analyzing chest X-ray images. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and employs transfer learning techniques using popular pre-trained models such as ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0.

Cardiomegaly is a significant indicator of various cardiovascular diseases and can be identified through radiological imaging. However, manual interpretation of chest X-rays is time-consuming and prone to human error. The proposed system seeks to address this issue by providing an automated solution that can quickly and accurately identify signs of cardiomegaly, thereby assisting medical professionals in making timely and informed decisions regarding patient care.
